## Milestone Three: Enhancement One — Software Design and Engineering
This artifact includes three Android application files: Registration, DatabaseHelper, and MainActivity, forming a user authentication system using SQLite for local data storage. Users can register with a username, email, and password, with their information securely stored. The app also allows login and session management, developed during my software course.

## Milestone Four: Enhancement Two — Algorithms and Data Structure
This Android application consists of three main files: Registration, DatabaseHelper, and MainActivity. It functions as a user authentication system using SQLite for local storage. Users can register with a username, email, and password, with secure authentication facilitated by efficient data structures. I emphasized optimal algorithms for data retrieval and storage during development, leveraging hash tables and indexing techniques to enhance performance and scalability.

## Milestone Five: Enhancement Three — Databases
The artifact is an Android SQLite User Management system, implemented as a DatabaseHelper class, which enables user registration and credential validation for a mobile app. The database is designed to handle user data, including username, email, and hashed passwords, utilizing SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting records, and checking credentials. This code is part of a larger project and was created as part of an enhancement of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, focusing specifically on improving user data handling and security features.
