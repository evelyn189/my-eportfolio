# Hi, I'm Evelyn

Welcome to my e-portfolio!

## Professional Self-Assessment
Over the course of the Computer Science program, I have gained technical expertise and real-world problem-solving skills that have prepared me to enter the software development industry confidently. This ePortfolio represents the culmination of that journey, showcasing enhanced projects that reflect my growth as a developer, designer, and critical thinker.
Through coursework in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, databases, and security, I have developed a solid foundation. Each project challenged me to refine my coding practices, strengthen my understanding of complex systems, and explore new technologies.
I have enhanced several key projects throughout this program to demonstrate my mastery of core computer science competencies. These include improvements in software design, implementation of more efficient algorithms and data structures, and effective use of relational databases to manage and secure data. Each enhancement was driven by thoughtful planning, peer and instructor feedback, and a focus on scalability and maintainability.
Developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my learning and present my technical abilities cohesively and professionally. It serves as an academic requirement and a platform to share my work with potential employers. By reviewing and refining each artifact, I have demonstrated my ability to learn, adapt, and continuously improve—essential skills in any technology career.
As I begin the next phase of my professional journey, the knowledge and experience I have gained throughout this program will support my continued growth. I am excited to contribute to meaningful software projects, collaborate with diverse teams, and tackle new challenges that drive innovation.

## Milestone Three: Enhancement One — Software Design and Engineering
This artifact includes three Android application files: Registration, DatabaseHelper, and MainActivity, forming a user authentication system using SQLite for local data storage. Users can register with a username, email, and password, with their information securely stored. The app also allows login and session management, developed during my software course.

## Milestone Four: Enhancement Two — Algorithms and Data Structure
This Android application consists of three main files: Registration, DatabaseHelper, and MainActivity. It functions as a user authentication system using SQLite for local storage. Users can register with a username, email, and password, with secure authentication facilitated by efficient data structures. I emphasized optimal algorithms for data retrieval and storage during development, leveraging hash tables and indexing techniques to enhance performance and scalability.

## Milestone Five: Enhancement Three — Databases
The artifact is an Android SQLite User Management system, implemented as a DatabaseHelper class, which enables user registration and credential validation for a mobile app. The database is designed to handle user data, including username, email, and hashed passwords, utilizing SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting records, and checking credentials. This code is part of a larger project and was created as part of an enhancement of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, focusing specifically on improving user data handling and security features.
